# FreeRTOS-FAT-CLI-for-RPi-Pico

## SD Cards on the Pico

This project is essentially a [FreeRTOS+FAT](https://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-Plus/FreeRTOS_Plus_FAT/index.html)
[Media Driver](https://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-Plus/FreeRTOS_Plus_FAT/Creating_a_file_system_media_driver.html)
for the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/),
using Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI),
based on [SDBlockDevice from Mbed OS 5](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v5.15/apis/sdblockdevice.html). 
It is wrapped up in a complete runnable project, with a command line interface provided by 
[FreeRTOS+CLI](https://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-Plus/FreeRTOS_Plus_CLI/FreeRTOS_Plus_Command_Line_Interface.html).

## Features:
* Supports multiple SD Cards
* Supports multiple SPIs
* Supports multiple SD Cards per SPI
* Supports Real Time Clock for maintaining file and directory time stamps
* Supports Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

## Resources Used
* At least one (depending on configuration) of the two Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) controllers is used.
* For each SPI controller used, two DMA channels are claimed with `dma_claim_unused_channel`.
* DMA_IRQ_0 is hooked with `irq_add_shared_handler` and enabled.
* For each SPI controller used, one GPIO is needed for each of RX, TX, and SCK. Note: each SPI controller can only use a limited set of GPIOs for these functions.
* For each SD card attached to an SPI controller, a GPIO is needed for CS, and, optionally, another for CD (Card Detect).

## Performance
Writing and reading a file of 0x10000000 (268,435,456) bytes (1/4 GiB) on a SanDisk 32GB card with SPI baud rate 12,500,000:
* Writing
  * Elapsed seconds 376
  * Transfer rate 697 KiB/s
* Reading
  * Elapsed seconds 315
  * Transfer rate 832 KiB/s

Surprisingly (to me), I have been able to push the SPI baud rate as far as 20,833,333 with a SanDisk Class 4 16 GB card:
* Writing
  * Elapsed seconds 226
  * Transfer rate 1159 KiB/s
* Reading
  * Elapsed seconds 232
  * Transfer rate 1129 KiB/s

 [but SDIO would be faster!]

## Prerequisites:
* Raspberry Pi Pico
* Something like the [SparkFun microSD Transflash Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/544)
* Breadboard and wires
* Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK
* (Optional) A couple of ~5-10kΩ resistors for pull-ups
* (Optional) A couple of ~100 pF capacitors for decoupling

## Dependencies:
* [FreeRTOS-Kernel](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel)
You will need to set FREERTOS_KERNEL_PATH in "Cmake: Configure Environment setting" 
or via `-DFREERTOS_KERNEL_PATH=/path/to/FreeRTOS-Kernel` on the `CMake` command line
to point to the installation. 
See [FreeRTOS-Kernel/portable/ThirdParty/GCC/RP2040/](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/tree/main/portable/ThirdParty/GCC/RP2040#using-this-port)

## Construction:
* The wiring is so simple that I didn't bother with a schematic. 
I just referred to the table above, wiring point-to-point from the Pin column on the Pico to the MicroSD 0 column on the Transflash.
* Card Detect is optional. Some SD card sockets have no provision for it. 
Even if it is provided by the hardware, if you have no requirement for it you can skip it and save a Pico I/O pin.
* You can choose to use either or both of the Pico's SPIs.
* Wires should be kept short and direct. SPI operates at HF radio frequencies.

### Pull Up Resistors
* The SPI MISO (**DO** on SD card, **SPI**x **RX** on Pico) is open collector (or tristate). It should be pulled up. The Pico internal gpio_pull_up is weak: around 56uA or 60kΩ. It's best to add an external pull up resistor of around 5kΩ to 3.3v. You might get away without one if you only run one SD card and don't push the SPI baud rate too high.
* The SPI Slave Select (SS), or Chip Select (CS) line enables one SPI slave of possibly multiple slaves on the bus. This is what enables the tristate buffer for Data Out (DO), among other things. It's best to pull CS up so that it doesn't float before the Pico GPIO is initialized. It is imperative to pull it up for any devices on the bus that aren't initialized. For example, if you have two SD cards on one bus but the firmware is aware of only one card (see hw_config); you can't let the CS float on the unused one. 

## Notes about prewired boards with SD card sockets:
* I don't think the [Pimoroni Pico VGA Demo Base](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pimoroni-pico-vga-demo-base) can work with a built in RP2040 SPI controller. It looks like RP20040 SPI0 SCK needs to be on GPIO 2, 6, or 18 (pin 4, 9, or 24, respectively), but Pimoroni wired it to GPIO 5 (pin 7).
* The [SparkFun RP2040 Thing Plus](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/rp2040-thing-plus-hookup-guide/hardware-overview) looks like it should work, on SPI1.
  * For SparkFun RP2040 Thing Plus:

    |       | SPI0  | GPIO  | Description            | 
    | ----- | ----  | ----- | ---------------------- |
    | MISO  | RX    | 12    | Master In, Slave Out   |
    | CS0   | CSn   | 09    | Slave (or Chip) Select |
    | SCK   | SCK   | 14    | SPI clock              |
    | MOSI  | TX    | 15    | Master Out, Slave In   |
    | CD    |       |       | Card Detect            |
  
* [Maker Pi Pico](https://www.cytron.io/p-maker-pi-pico) looks like it could work on SPI1. It has CS on GPIO 15, which is not a pin that the RP2040 built in SPI1 controller would drive as CS, but this driver controls CS explicitly with `gpio_put`, so it doesn't matter.

## Firmware:
* Follow instructions in [Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf) to set up the development environment.

## Troubleshooting
* The first thing to try is lowering the SPI baud rate (see hw_config.c). This will also make it easier to use things like logic analyzers.
* Make sure the SD card(s) are getting enough power. Try an external supply. Try adding a decoupling capacitor between Vcc and GND. 
  * Hint: check voltage while formatting card. It must be 2.7 to 3.6 volts. 
  * Hint: If you are powering a Pico with a PicoProbe, try adding a USB cable to a wall charger to the Pico under test.
* Try another brand of SD card. Some handle the SPI interface better than others. (Most consumer devices like cameras or PCs use the SDIO interface.) I have had good luck with SanDisk.
* Tracing: Most of the source files have a couple of lines near the top of the file like:
```
#define TRACE_PRINTF(fmt, args...) // Disable tracing
//#define TRACE_PRINTF printf // Trace with printf
```
You can swap the commenting to enable tracing of what's happening in that file.
* Logic analyzer: for less than ten bucks, something like this [Comidox 1Set USB Logic Analyzer Device Set USB Cable 24MHz 8CH 24MHz 8 Channel UART IIC SPI Debug for Arduino ARM FPGA M100 Hot](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KW445DJ/) and [PulseView - sigrok](https://sigrok.org/) make a nice combination for looking at SPI, as long as you don't run the baud rate too high. 
* Get yourself a protoboard and solder everything. So much more reliable than solderless breadboard!

## Next Steps
* There is a simple example of using the API in the `simple_example` subdirectory.
* There is a demonstration data logging application in `FreeRTOS-FAT-CLI-for-RPi-Pico/src/data_log_demo.c`. 
It runs as a separate task, and can be launched from the CLI with the `data_log_demo` command.
(Stop it with the `die` command.)
It records the temperature as reported by the RP2040 internal Temperature Sensor once per second 
in files named something like `/sd0/data/2021-02-27/21.csv`.
Use this as a starting point for your own data logging application!

If you want to use FreeRTOS+FAT+CLI as a library embedded in another project, use something like:
  ```
  git submodule add git@github.com:carlk3/FreeRTOS-FAT-CLI-for-RPi-Pico.git
  ```
  or
  ```
  git submodule add https://github.com/carlk3/FreeRTOS-FAT-CLI-for-RPi-Pico.git
  ```
  
You will need to pick up the library in CMakeLists.txt:
```
add_subdirectory(FreeRTOS-FAT-CLI-for-RPi-Pico/FreeRTOS+FAT+CLI build)
target_link_libraries(_my_app_ FreeRTOS+FAT+CLI)
```  

Happy hacking!

## Appendix: Adding Additional Cards
When you're dealing with information storage, it's always nice to have redundancy. There are many possible combinations of SPIs and SD cards. One of these is putting multiple SD cards on the same SPI bus, at a cost of one (or two) additional Pico I/O pins (depending on whether or you care about Card Detect). I will illustrate that example here. 

To add a second SD card on the same SPI, connect it in parallel, except that it will need a unique GPIO for the Card Select/Slave Select (CSn) and another for Card Detect (CD) (optional).

Name|SPI0|GPIO|Pin |SPI|SDIO|MicroSD 0|MicroSD 1
----|----|----|----|---|----|---------|---------
CD1||14|19||||CD
CS1||15|20|SS or CS|DAT3||CS
MISO|RX|16|21|DO|DAT0|DO|DO
CS0||17|22|SS or CS|DAT3|CS|
SCK|SCK|18|24|SCLK|CLK|SCK|SCK
MOSI|TX|19|25|DI|CMD|DI|DI
CD0||22|29|||CD|
|||||||
GND|||18, 23|||GND|GND
3v3|||36|||3v3|3v3

### Wiring: 
As you can see from the table above, the only new signals are CD1 and CS1. Otherwise, the new card is wired in parallel with the first card.
### Firmware:
* `sd_driver/hw_config.c` must be edited to add a new instance to `static sd_card_t sd_cards[]`
